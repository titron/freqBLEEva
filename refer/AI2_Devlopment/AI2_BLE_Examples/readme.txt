Is there anyone who has experience displaying data generated by Bluno(BLE) using MIT app inventor?
a lot of examples are available using the standard Bluetooth but not the BLE. I am facing challenges displaying simple data on my phone.

I resolved this by using. Methods WriteBytes+RegisterFor Bytes+readBytes in Event "BluetoothLE1.connected". So I got resdings in Event "Bluetooth bytesReceived.
It also runs with Float, and String Methods.
